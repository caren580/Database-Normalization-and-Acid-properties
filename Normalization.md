# DATABASE NORMALIZATION
## What is normalization?
Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes of the database to reduce or eliminate data redundancy (having the same data but at different places).

## Why do we need Normalization?
<ul>
<li>Reduces redundancy: Redundancy is when the same information is stored multiple times, and a good way of avoiding this is by splitting data into smaller tables.</li>
<li>Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.</li>
<li>Minimizes update anomalies: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.</li>
<li>Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.</li>
</ul>
